a stupid and crude javascript game.

I hate myself for making this.

It's dumb and pathetic.

I completely regret having the idea to make this.

I just can't resist making an idea no one has done before.

The entire premise of the game is the rule is that it's super creepy when someone uses the urinal next to you when other urinals exist. The object of the game is to _not_ do that.
